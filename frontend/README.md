# Crop Yield Frontend

Vue3 + Element Plus single-page application that visualises agricultural data and interacts with the Spring Boot backend.

## Available scripts

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The dev server proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8080` so you can run it alongside the backend without additional configuration.
